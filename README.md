# cy-data-test
main

Sample project to demonstrate a cy.dataTest Cypress custom command.

## Pre-requirements
It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

I used versions v18.17.1 and 9.6.7 of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

## Installation
Run npm install (or npm i for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

This test can ran in Mobile viewport and Desktop Viewport

### Desktop

Run 'npm run test' (or npm t for the short version) to run the test in headless mode.

Or, run 'npm run open ' to open Cypress in interactive mode.

### Mobile

Run ' npm run cy:mobile:headless' (or npm t for the short version) to run the test in Mobile headless mode.

Or, ' npm run cy:mobile' to open Cypress in Mobile interactive mode.
